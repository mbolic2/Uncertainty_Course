    "b- From the first scatter plot, we might think that there is a correlation between the 2 methods, but in reality, this doesn't tell us anything about the systematic error and the random error. Having similar characteristics is not enough for good agreement between methods. In other words, having a cluster of points around a line makes it hard to see any patterns that may be present. On the other, with scatter plot differences vs. means, helps in realizing key features of disagreement such as fixed and proportional biases. From the above figure, we can see that we have a fixed bias of -1.67. This is not obvious from the scatter plot alone. On the other hand, it seems that there is no proportional bias.\n",

    "c- From Bland Altman plot, we cannot see any evidence of heteroscedasticity. On the other hand, we can assume the existance of outliers, especially for those lying outside mean +/- 2*std. "
